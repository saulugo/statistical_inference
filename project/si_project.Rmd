#Overview
The purpose of this report is to compare the **Exponential Distribution** to the **Central Limit Theorem**. Using a Simulation, it will be shown that the distribution of averages of n number of random exponential variables becomes that of an standard nomral as n sample size increases. This is exactly what the Central Limit Theorem states.

#Simulations
To study the exponential distribution, let's first compare the distribution of **10000** random exponentials with the distribution of 40 averages of random exponentials:


```{r exp_dist_simulation}
set.seed(5)
lambda = 0.2
n = 10000
y <- rexp(n, rate = lambda)
hist(y,ylab="prob(y)")
mean_y <- mean(y)
mean_y
sd_y <- sd(y)
sd_y
```

So, it is known that the teorethical mean of the exponential distribution is equal to 1/lambda. 
        - In this example, lambda = 0.2, so 1/lambda = 5
        - As it was shown in the previous R chunk, the mean of these ```{r mean_y}```
